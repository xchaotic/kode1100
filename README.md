# Kode1100 is now Paxos.net.pl
We have been running Kode1100 for exactly 10 years (2007-2017), mostly as a consultancy helping publishers become digital natives.
With the fast pace of technology change, our focus has changed and we are concentrating our effort on the next steps: running things in the cloud (devops), setting up and maintaining multi-model database systems, protecting the data.
To reflect that change, we have created a new company called PAXOS - the name comes from a family of protocols for establishing consensus.
